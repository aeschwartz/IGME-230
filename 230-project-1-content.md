# By the Blade
###
By the Blade is a PC real-time action-adventure role-playing game that tells a story like no other.

## Story
###
Armed with only his magical sword, the luceblade, Caleb sets out on a mission to rid the land of the murk enshrouding it.

Raised and mentored by Zeno, the elder of Sylvhaven, Caleb is kind yet aware of his reality. He lives in a world in which the forces of darkness have been slowly taking over since long before he was even born. As a young adult, Caleb finds himself riddled with insecurities about where his true calling lay, with the sword or with the pen. He has been confined mostly to the village and surrounding forest his whole life, but he is at peace with this until one day...

## Art Direction
###
The game will have pixel art sprites for the characters, but also fully drawn versions of each for dialogue scenes. On the other hand, the music will be orchestral, composed with the XPand!2 plugin's MIDI selection. I'll source sound effects from free sound banks or create them artificially.

## Gameplay
###
Gameplay will center around a combination of puzzle-solving and mechanical skill, with a focus around character switching to navigate through certain parts of the world. Players will have 8-directional movement, a couple of buttons to use abilities, a button to switch characters, and access to an inventory. The game will accept controller and keyboard/mouse input although the mouse specifically may see little to no implementation at all. New players will learn the controls through small tool-tips and dialogue that appear at the beginning of certain parts of the world.
